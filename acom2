Description
Improving Image Management and Delivery Efficiency

The EAP Strategic Solutions team successfully completed the migration of over 350 Cloudera Docker images to the newly established Citi Artifact Repository:
docker-cto-dev-local.artifactrepository.citigroup.net/cti-eapbigdata-165345/cdp-private

This transition enables the decommissioning of the older local Docker registry (sd-wv58-kflz.nam.nsroot.net:5000/cdp-private) and paves the way for centralized, scalable, and SDLC-compliant Docker image management across Citi platforms.

Key Achievements:

Migrated and structured 350+ Docker images under the cdp-private repo in Artifactory.

Verified image visibility and repo structure through the Artifactory native browser.

Validated new image path references to support future deployments in SDLC and non-prod environments.

Enabled future automation of Cloudera Data Services deployments using Artifactory-hosted images.

Benefits to the team:

Reduces maintenance overhead by decommissioning local Docker repo servers.

Enables secure, versioned image hosting in Citi's standard artifact ecosystem.

Aligns with enterprise governance and compliance for container image management.

Supports reusability and traceability across SDLC environments.

Next Steps:

Integrate new image repo paths into CDS installation and automation scripts.

Coordinate final decommissioning of legacy Docker registry infrastructure.

Implement validation checks and reporting for image updates in Artifactory.
